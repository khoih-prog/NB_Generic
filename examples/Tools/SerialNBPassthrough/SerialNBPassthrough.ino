   SerialSARAPassthrough sketch

   This sketch allows you to send AT commands from the USB CDC serial port
   of the MKR NB 1500 board to the onboard ublox SARA-R410 cellular module.

   For a list of supported AT commands see:
   https://www.u-blox.com/sites/default/files/u-blox-CEL_ATCommands_%28UBX-13002752%29.pdf

   Circuit:
   - MKR NB 1500 board
   - Antenna
   - SIM card

   Make sure the Serial Monitor's line ending is set to "Both NL and CR" or "Carriage Return"
